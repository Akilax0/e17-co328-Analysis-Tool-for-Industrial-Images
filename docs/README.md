## Problem Overview

 The injection molding manufacturing process is used for producing parts by injecting molten material into a mold.In our specific use case, we focus on plastic injection molding.One of the common problems in this process is when plastic residue gets stuck or left behind in the mold.Thus leading to damages to the mold , defects in products and ultimately resulting in unwanted business costs.

## Other Sub Topics

The above issue is mainly handled by checking the molds manually on each iteration. This has become a heavy burden as it costs time and money to supply this labor at a high frequency . These machines are highly capable of working on full automatic but this issue has caused a significant overhead in the manufacturing process.As a solution, a device was built to capture images of the mold in near IR frequency to check for stuck particles. Currently, this is being implemented to mitigate this issue.The implementation is purely run to check for defects using an image processing algorithm with a given set of parameters.The problem here is that although this implementation has proven to be a better alternative there is a limitation at which how effective or how true the results from this device is Currently, the built device only gives out a binary output as positive a negative. Since there is a limitation for the flexibility of the used algorithm is these results do not always turn out to be true. Hence our focus is to elevate the performance of the implemented device to produce better results.
